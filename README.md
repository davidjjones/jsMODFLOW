## jsMODFLOW

This project is to transpose portions of the groundwater modeling code [MODFLOW-2005](http://water.usgs.gov/ogw/modflow/MODFLOW.html) from FORTRAN to JavaScript, allowing simple models to be executed within a web browser. Moving the modeling environment to the web browser will allow a wider audience of users to interact with groundwater models in a controlled way. 

### Supported Modules
This version partially supports the following MODFLOW modules. Parameterization is not supported.

- BAS
- BCF
- SIP
- WEL
- DRN
- RCH 
- RIV
- EVT
- GHB

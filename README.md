## jsMODFLOW

This project is to transpose portions of the groundwater modeling code [MODFLOW-2005](http://water.usgs.gov/ogw/modflow/MODFLOW.html) from FORTRAN to JavaScript, allowing simple models to be executed within a web browser. Although modeling is a critical tool for effective groundwater management, it can be difficult to understand model assumptions, limitations and results. Moving the modeling environment to the web browser will allow a wider audience of users to interact with groundwater models in a controlled way. 

The purpose of this project is not to create an online interface for model construction or post-processing.
